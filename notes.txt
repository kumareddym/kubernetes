KUBERNETES COMPLETE

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.
POD:

A Pod is the basic execution unit of a Kubernetes application--the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy.
**Each POD many have multiple containers. But “one-container-per-Pod” is recommended.
Each Pod is meant to run a single instance of a given application.
Pods provide two kinds of shared resources for their constituent containers: networking and storage.
Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address. Every container in a Pod shares the network namespace, including the IP address and network ports.
A Pod can specify a set of shared storage volumes. All containers in the Pod can access the shared volumes, allowing those containers to share data.
A Pod is not a process, but an environment for running a container. A Pod persists until it is deleted.
NODES:

A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes,and node may be a VM or physical machine.
Each node contains the services necessary to run pods and is managed by the master components. The services on a node include the container runtime, kubelet and kube-proxy.
Node is externally created by cloud providers.

Features of orchestration tools:
1. High availability or no downtime
2. scalability or high performance
3. Disaster  recovery- restore and backup

Kubernetes - Master Machine Components--->
1. etcd: It stores the configuration information which can be used by each of the nodes in the cluster. It is a distributed key value Store which is accessible to all.
2. API Server(MAIN): The Kubernetes API server validates and configures data for the api objects which include pods, services, replicationcontrollers, and others. It helps in communication of pods by using kubectl
3. Controller Manager: It is responsible for maintaining desired states mentioned in the manifest.
4. Scheduler: It watches for new work tasks and assigns them to healthy nodes in the cluster. The scheduler is responsible for workload utilization and allocating pod to new node.
